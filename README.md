# Hello DALL-E!

This is a simple demo of OpenAI's [DALL-E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/) model, which generates images from text descriptions.

### TODO

- [ ] Add a demo site to generates images from text descriptions via DALL-E API.
- [ ] Add [outpainting](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e-introducing-outpainting) to extend creativity and tell a bigger story with DALLÂ·E images of any size.
